## About 
This Repository contains implementation of ICM( Intrinsic Curiosity reward ) module by plugging it into three different algorithms i.e DQN , A3C and PPO. This whole code is based on the ICML paper introduced by Deepak Pathak,Pulkit Agrawal,Alexei A. Efros,Trevor Darrell in the paper Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction. ( For more information visit https://pathak22.github.io/noreward-rl/ ).

## Organization 
The repo is divided into 3 parts corresponding to each algorithm implemented. PPO and A3C is a group of python files in a folder while DQN is a jupyer notebook. For running just clone the repo and execute the code normally.

## Demo for PPO + ICM:
